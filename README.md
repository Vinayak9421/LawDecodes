# LawDecodes – AI-Powered Legal & Government Document Simplifier

## 📌 Project Title
**LawDecodes** – An AI-powered web platform that simplifies legal and government documents into easy-to-understand language for the common citizen.

---

## 📝 Problem Statement
Most citizens struggle to understand government schemes, legal notices, contracts, and official documents due to:
- Complex sentence structures  
- Technical jargon and legalese  
- Long, tedious formatting  
- English-only or overly formal Hindi versions  
- Lack of accessible summaries or translations  

**Who is affected?**
- Common citizens with limited education  
- Senior citizens or visually impaired people  
- Rural populations with minimal legal exposure  
- Students, journalists, and activists needing simplified interpretation  

**Real-world impact:**
- Missed benefits and schemes  
- Signing documents without understanding them  
- Exploitation due to lack of comprehension  
- Dependence on middlemen or misinformation  
- Inequity in access to rights and resources

## 💡 Proposed Solution
A **web-based platform** where users can:
1. Upload documents (PDF, image, or text)  
2. Automatically extract and simplify content using AI  
3. Compare **original vs simplified** versions side-by-side  
4. Access legal term definitions via tooltips  
5. Translate simplified text into Indian languages  
6. Listen to the explanation via text-to-speech  
7. Ask follow-up questions via an integrated chatbot
